## Requirement

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com)

## Laravel Version Compatibilities

| Laravel | Package |
|---------|---------|
| 10.x.x  | 4.x     |
| 9.x.x   | 3.x     |
| 8.x.x   | 2.x     |

## Install

Requires this package with composer via command:

```shell

```

## Environment Variable

Register your Cloudinary account details [here](https://cloudinary.com/console).
Then add these lines to your .env.

```dotenv
FILESYSTEM_DISK=cloudinary

CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_SECURE=true
```

## Filesystem Configuration

Register cloudinary driver configuration in `config/filesystems.php` at disks section as follows

```php
'cloudinary' => [
    'driver'         => 'cloudinary',
    'api_key'        => env('CLOUDINARY_API_KEY'),
    'api_secret'     => env('CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET'),
    'cloud_name'     => env('CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME'),
    'secure'         => env('CLOUDINARY_SECURE', true),
    'resource_types' => [
        'image' => [
            'png',
            'jpeg',
            'jpg',
        ],
        'video' => [
            'mp4',
            'avi',
            'mp3',
            'flac',
        ],
        'raw'   => [
            'pdf',
            'xlsx',
            'csv',
            'txt',
        ],
    ],
],
```

The secure option is applied when generating url from storage, when `secure = true` will use `https`
otherwise `secure = false` will use `http` as protocol.

The resource_types option is applied when generating resource type & public id whenever we call storage method such as
write, writeStream, url, has, etc. Registers the appropriate file extensions according to cloudinary resource type e.g:
png in image, mp4 in video, xlsx in raw, for audio files registers in video. `The default resource type is image`,
visit [image upload api reference](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference#upload_method) for more information.

## Tips

To use pre-defined filename as public ID when uploading to cloudinary, you need to tweak some configuration
in `Settings -> Upload -> Upload presets` as follows:

- Click edit button on signed mode preset, initial preset is `ml_default` you can update it.

- Turn on `Use filename or externally defined public ID` to using the pre-defined filename instead of random characters.

- Turn off `Unique filename` to prevent cloudinary from adding random characters at the end of filename.
- Click `Save` and you're good to go.
